%feature("docstring") OTAGRUM::ContinuousBayesianNetworkFactory
"Estimate a ContinuousBayesianNetwork distribution.

Parameters
----------
factories : sequence of :class:`~openturns.Distribution`
    The models to test for each local distribution. Default value is
    (:class:`~openturns.BernsteinCopulaFactory`).
namedDAG : :class:`~otagrum.NamedDAG`
    The structure of the underlying graphical model. Default value is
    :class:`~otagrum.NamedDAG()`
alpha : float
    Threshold on the p-value for the conditional independence tests. Default
    value is *0.1*.
maximumConditioningSetSize : int
    Maximum conditional set size. Default value is *5*.

Notes
-----
    A *namedDAG* parameter of size 0 (ie equal to NamedDAG(), default value) means
    that the structure has also to be learnt, using the
    :class:`~otagrum.ContinuousPC` algorithm.
    The parameters *alpha* and *maximumConditioningSetSize* are used only if the
    :class:`~otagrum.NamedDAG` has to be learnt.
    The following keys in :class:`~openturns.ResourceMap` can be used to fine-tune
    the learning process:
           
    - *'ContinuousBayesianNetworkFactory-DefaultAlpha'* to set the p-value
      threshold for the independence test in :class:`~otagrum.ContinuousPC`.
      Default value is *0.1*.
    - *'ContinuousBayesianNetworkFactory-DefaultMaximumConditioningSetSize'*
      to set the maximum dimension of the parents in the Bayesian network.
      Default value is *5*.
    - *'ContinuousBayesianNetworkFactory-WorkInCopulaSpace'* to indicate if the
      estimated distribution should be a copula. Default value is *True*
    - *'ContinuousBayesianNetworkFactory-LearningRatio'* to set the proportion of
      the given sample to be used for the learning phase. Default value is *0.5*.

    If the parameter *factories* contains more than one factory, the given sample
    is split into a learning sample and a validation sample. At each node,
    each of these factories is used to build a local model using the learning
    sample, then the best model is the one maximizing the log-likelihood of the
    validation sample.
     
Examples
--------
>>> import otagrum
>>> import openturns as ot
>>> factories = [ot.NormalCopulaFactory(), ot.BernsteinCopulaFactory()]
>>> ndag = otagrum.NamedDAG()
>>> threshold = 0.1
>>> maxParents = 5
>>> factory = otagrum.ContinuousBayesianNetworkFactory(factories, ndag, threshold, maxParents)"
