The purpose of this document is to present the OpenTURNS-aGrUM module, which enables to define Bayesian networks with aGrUM and to manipulate them with OpenTURNS.

It offers to the user the ability to:
\begin{itemize}
\item define discretized aGrUM distributions from OpenTURNS distributions
\item build OpenTURNS objects from aGrUM Bayesian networks
\item extract marginal distributions of aGrUM Bayesian networks as OpenTURNS distributions
\end{itemize}
This document is organised according to the Open TURNS documentation : 
\begin{itemize}
\item a \itshape{Reference Guide} which gives some theoretical basis on bayseian networks,
\item a \itshape{Use cases Guide} which details scripts in python (the Textual Interface langage of Open TURNS) and helps the User to learn as quickly as possible the manipulation of the $otagrum$ module,
\item the \itshape{User Manual} which details the $otagrum$ objects and give the list of their methods,
\item the \itshape{Examples Guide} which provides at the moment only one example performed with the  $otagrum$ module.
\end{itemize}
